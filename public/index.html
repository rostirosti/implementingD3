    <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Smoking and Poverty</h2>
    <p>Adults who have lower levels of educational attainment, who are unemployed, or who live at, near, or below the U.S. federal poverty level are considered to have low socioeconomic status (SES).

      According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the poverty rate in 2016 was 12.7%.1 In 2017, the percentage of people aged 18 and older who had completed only high school was 28.9%, and the percentage who had completed high school up to grade 11 but had no diploma was 4.2%.2
      
      In the U.S., people living below the poverty level and people having lower levels of educational attainment have higher rates of cigarette smoking than the general population.</p>
